# Crater.py

## Disclaimer
The following code was written in my free time. It is not meant to be reflection of my professional work nor will I be working to improve it.

## Summary
The following could is an incredibly simple script to threshold a primarly green image for blobs. Specifically this script was used to count craters in Eastern Ukraine.

## Requirements
Python 3.9.1 (but anything after 3.7.1) should work.
OpenCV 4.6.0
Numpy 1.22.4

## Execute
To execute the script simply run in root directory:
```
python scripts/crater.py
```

To change the image, modify the image path on line 22 in `crater.py`.
